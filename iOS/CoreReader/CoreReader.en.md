> The spiritual successor of "Simple Reader" XD



## Start

For my new needs, and consolidating the new knowledge learned recently, I made this app.

Combine reviews in "Simple Reader" with my thinking, hoping to make a more beautiful app.



## And Then

After more than a dozen versions updates, the basic functions have been realized, but the only regret is that the theme setting is a little inferior than "Simple Reader", alas, how could this be worthy of the identity of successor!

So it took a long time in Version 2.2 to remake and reinforcement of the interface (as well as a internal upgrade). 

Finally, a more powerful customized theme is implemented with the new interface,  which supports the modification of all interface colors. Eventually, it went far beyond "Simple Reader", a historic moment was born! 



## However

The new iPhone is so expensive, so I bought my first Android phone. After all, I make app for myself to solve problems while using them. In the future, I will focus on Android and Mac development.

Ok.. Will the updates slow down here? I don't know, Since it is no longer due to my own needs, it can only rely on interest. Maybe more features will be added, there are a lot of suggestions from the feedback.
